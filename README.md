### Section 1: Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)

* **Core Principle:** Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is a term for several high-throughput technologies that allow for
  the parallel sequencing of millions to billions of short DNA fragments simultaneously. The dominant method used in
  genomics today, particularly for single-cell applications, is **Illumina's Sequencing by Synthesis (SBS)**.

* **How Sequencing by Synthesis Works:**
    1. **Library Preparation:** The process starts with the collection of DNA to be sequenced (in our case, the barcoded
       cDNA from the single-nucleus workflow). This DNA is fragmented, and special DNA sequences called **adapters** are
       ligated to both ends of each fragment. These adapters are essential, acting as "docking sites" for the sequencing
       process.
    2. **Cluster Generation:** The prepared DNA library is loaded onto a specialized glass slide called a **flow cell**.
       The surface of the flow cell is coated with millions of short DNA strands that are complementary to the adapters.
       Each DNA fragment from the library binds to a complementary strand on the flow cell. A process called **bridge
       amplification** then creates a localized, dense cluster of thousands of identical copies of that single DNA
       fragment. Millions of these clusters are generated simultaneously across the flow cell, each originating from a
       single molecule.
    3. **Sequencing Cycles:** This is the "synthesis" part of SBS. The machine performs a cyclical chemical reaction to
       read the sequence one base at a time.
        * **Step A (Incorporate):** The machine flows a mixture of all four DNA nucleotides (A, C, G, T) across the flow
          cell. Each nucleotide has been modified in two ways: it carries a unique fluorescent color tag, and it has a "
          reversible terminator" that prevents any more bases from being added after it. A single nucleotide binds to
          its complementary base on the template strand in each cluster.
        * **Step B (Image):** The flow cell is washed to remove any unbound nucleotides. A laser then excites the entire
          slide, and a high-resolution camera takes a picture. The color of the fluorescence in each cluster identifies
          which base (A, C, G, or T) was just added.
        * **Step C (Cleave):** A chemical reaction cleaves off both the fluorescent tag and the reversible terminator,
          allowing the next nucleotide to be added in the subsequent cycle.
    4. **Data Readout:** Steps A, B, and C are repeated for hundreds of cycles. In each cycle, the machine records the
       color of every cluster on the flow cell. The final output is a massive text file containing millions of "reads"
       —the sequences of the DNA fragments (e.g., `GATTACA...`), each tied to a specific cluster.

### Section 2: Single-Nucleus RNA Sequencing (snRNA-seq)

* **Primary Goal:** To measure the abundance of messenger RNA (mRNA) in thousands of individual nuclei. This allows for
  the classification of cell types and the study of cellular states based on gene expression profiles. It is especially
  useful for tissues where whole cells are difficult to isolate, such as brain tissue or archived frozen samples.

* **The Role of Commercial Platforms (10x Genomics, BD Rhapsody):**
    * Platforms like the 10x Genomics Chromium or the BD Rhapsody are **not sequencers**. They are sophisticated
      microfluidic "front-end" systems designed to perform the critical upstream steps of single-cell capture and
      barcoding with high efficiency.
    * They automate the process of isolating single nuclei, encapsulating them in droplets with barcoded beads, and
      performing the molecular reactions (lysis, mRNA capture, reverse transcription) inside each droplet.
    * The final output of a 10x Genomics or BD Rhapsody instrument run is a "sequencing-ready library"—the pooled,
      barcoded cDNA that is then loaded onto an NGS sequencer (like an Illumina NovaSeq) for the actual sequencing step
      described in Section 1.

* **The snRNA-seq Mechanism: A Step-by-Step Breakdown**
    1. **Nucleus Isolation:**
        * The process exploits the structural difference between the cell membrane (a single lipid bilayer) and the more
          robust nuclear envelope (a double membrane). A mild detergent selectively dissolves the cell membrane,
          releasing the intact nucleus.
    2. **Droplet-based Capture (The "Front-End"):**
        * A microfluidic controller (e.g., 10x Chromium) partitions a stream of nuclei and a stream of barcoded beads
          into picoliter-sized droplets. The system is calibrated to favor the encapsulation of one nucleus and one bead
          per droplet.
    3. **mRNA Capture and Molecular Barcoding:**
        * Inside each droplet, the nucleus is lysed.
        * The bead is coated with DNA oligonucleotides that act as specific capture molecules.
        * **Capture Target:** Most mRNA molecules in eukaryotes (like humans) have a "poly-A tail" (a string of Adenine
          bases). This distinguishes it from other types of RNA (like ribosomal RNA (rRNA) or transfer RNA (tRNA), which
          are much more abundant in a cell).
        * **Capture Hook:** Each oligo has a "poly(dT) tail" (a string of Thymine bases) that specifically binds to the
          mRNA's poly-A tail.
        * **Barcodes:** Each oligo also contains two crucial identifiers:
            * **Cell Barcode:** Uniquely identifies the nucleus in that droplet.
            * **Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI):** Uniquely identifies each individual mRNA molecule captured.
    4. **Library Preparation and Sequencing:**
        * After the reactions in the droplets [3], the emulsion is broken, and the now-barcoded cDNA is pooled. Adapters
          are
          added to this cDNA to make it compatible with an NGS machine. This final collection of molecules is the "
          library."
        * This library is loaded onto an NGS sequencer, which reads the sequence of the mRNA fragment as well as the
          attached cell barcode and UMI.

* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Data Quality**
    * **Number of Nuclei Captured:** The total number of cells with sufficient data for analysis.
    * **Median Genes per Nucleus:** The median number of different genes detected per nucleus; a measure of sensitivity.
    * **Median UMIs per Nucleus:** The median count of unique mRNA molecules detected per nucleus; a measure of capture
      efficiency.
    * **Doublet Rate:** The estimated percentage of "barcodes" that actually represent two or more nuclei captured in
      the same droplet.
    * **Mitochondrial RNA Content:** In snRNA-seq, this percentage should be very low. A high value can indicate
      contamination from the cytoplasm due to ruptured nuclei.

### Section 3: Slide-tag: Adding Spatial Coordinates to Single-Nucleus Data

* **Core Principle:** This method tags individual cell nuclei with spatial barcodes *while they are still in an intact
  tissue slice*. Instead of capturing molecules onto a surface, it releases barcodes from a surface up into the tissue,
  allowing for high-quality single-cell data while retaining the original spatial coordinates.

* **The Mechanism**
    1. **The Barcoded Array:** The technology uses a glass slide coated with a dense, random monolayer of 10-micron
       DNA-barcoded beads. The massive diversity of unique spatial barcodes on these beads is generated using a chemical
       process called **split-pool combinatorial synthesis**. This chemical process involves repeatedly splitting the
       entire pool of beads, adding a specific DNA base to each subgroup, and then pooling them back together. This
       results in an exponential increase in unique barcode sequences with each cycle. The physical (x, y) coordinate of
       every unique barcode sequence on the bead array is determined beforehand by performing an in situ sequencing
       reaction directly on the slide, creating a definitive digital map.
    2. **Spatial Tagging in Tissue:** A fresh-frozen tissue slice (typically 20 µm thick) is placed on the slide. UV
       light is used to cleave linkers on the beads, releasing the spatial barcodes to diffuse into the tissue and tag
       the biomolecules within the nuclei. This upstream tagging step adds only 10-60 minutes to the workflow.
    3. **Standard Workflow Integration:** After tagging, the tissue is dissociated into a single-nucleus suspension.
       This suspension is then used as a standard input for droplet-based platforms (e.g., 10x Genomics), where a
       second, single-cell barcode is added.
    4. **Calculating Position:** The physical (x, y) coordinate of every unique barcode on the slide is pre-mapped. A
       nucleus in the tissue absorbs the highest concentration of barcodes from the bead directly beneath it, but also a
       decreasing amount from neighboring beads, following an approximate Gaussian diffusion profile. By analyzing the
       specific ratio of different spatial barcodes captured by a single nucleus, its original location can be
       computationally reconstructed.

#### How Two Separate Libraries Are Created

* **Step 1: Encapsulation in a Droplet**
    * A single, spatially-tagged nucleus is encapsulated in a water-in-oil droplet.
    * Inside that same droplet is a single **10x Genomics gel bead**. This bead is critical. It is covered in its own
      DNA oligonucleotides, each containing:
        * A **Cell Barcode (CB):** Identical for all oligos on a single bead, but unique to that bead. These are created
          using split-pool combinatorial synthesis. This is the "address label" that links everything from this droplet
          back to one original nucleus.
        * A **Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI):** A short random sequence that is different for each oligo on the bead.
          This helps count individual starting molecules to avoid PCR bias.
        * A **Primer sequence** (e.g., a poly(T) sequence to capture mRNA).

* **Step 2: Lysis and Reverse Transcription in the Droplet**
    * The gel bead dissolves, and the nucleus is lysed (broken open) inside the droplet, releasing all its contents.
    * Now, floating inside the droplet are:
        1. The nucleus's **mRNA molecules** (which have poly-A tails).
        2. The **Trekker spatial barcode oligos** that the nucleus absorbed.
        3. The oligos from the 10x gel bead (with the CB and UMI).
    * Reverse transcription now happens, creating two different types of cDNA molecules **in parallel**:
        * **Gene Expression (GEX) cDNA:** The poly(T) primer on the 10x oligo binds to the poly(A) tail of an mRNA
          molecule. This creates a long cDNA molecule containing the **[Gene Sequence] + [UMI] + [Cell Barcode]**.
        * **Spatial Barcode (SB) cDNA:** The Trekker spatial barcode oligo has its own specific, known sequence. A
          different primer on the 10x gel bead (or added to the mix) is designed to bind to this specific sequence. This
          creates a very short cDNA molecule containing the **[Spatial Barcode Sequence] + [UMI] + [Cell Barcode]**.

* **Step 3: Breaking the Droplets and Physical Separation**
    * After reverse transcription, all the droplets are broken, and the newly created cDNA from all nuclei is pooled
      together.
    * This pool contains a mix of long GEX cDNA and short SB cDNA. They are physically separated into two tubes using
      standard molecular biology techniques:
        * **Size Selection:** The most common method is using SPRI beads (Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization). By
          changing the concentration of the beads and buffer, you can selectively precipitate DNA fragments of different
          sizes. One concentration is used to isolate the long GEX cDNA, and another is used to isolate the short SB
          cDNA.
        * **Specific PCR Amplification:** Following size selection, each pool of cDNA is amplified using different sets
          of primers. One primer set is designed to only amplify the GEX cDNA, and a completely different primer set is
          designed to only amplify the SB cDNA. This creates the final two, physically separate libraries ready for
          sequencing.

#### Why Sequencing Depth is Different

* **Gene Expression Library (Needs High Depth: 20,000-50,000 reads/nucleus):**
    * The goal here is to comprehensively profile the entire transcriptome. A single nucleus contains thousands of
      different types of mRNA molecules at varying levels of abundance (from very rare to very common).
    * You need to sequence very deeply to have a high probability of capturing and counting not just the abundant genes,
      but also the rare regulatory genes that might define the cell's state. It's a complex measurement problem.

* **Spatial Barcode Library (Needs Low Depth: 1,000-5,000 reads/nucleus):**
    * The goal here is much simpler: identify which few dozen spatial barcodes are present in the nucleus and determine
      their relative abundance (their ratio).
    * You only need enough sequencing reads to confidently identify these barcodes and count their UMIs. Once you have
      read each unique spatial barcode UMI a few times, sequencing it more provides no new information. It's a simple
      identification and counting problem, which is why it is "inexpensive" in terms of sequencing cost.

#### Performance and Key Metrics

    * **Spatial Precision:** The reconstruction method achieves a high spatial localization accuracy, estimated to be
      **~3.5 µm**, enabling sub-cellular resolution.
    * **Data Fidelity:** The process does not degrade the quality of the gene expression data. The profiles are shown to
      be **indistinguishable from standard snRNA-seq**, with correlations (r > 0.95) for cell types, UMIs per cell, and
      gene expression levels.
    * **Sensitivity & Recovery:** The method maintains high sensitivity, recovering **2,000 to 10,000 UMIs per nucleus
      **.
      The overall efficiency of capturing and assigning a high-quality spatial position is around **12-15%** of the
      total nuclei in the tissue section (a ~25-30% recovery of nuclei, of which about 50% are spatially assigned).
    * **Sequencing Efficiency:** The spatial information is inexpensive to sequence. The spatial barcode library
      requires a very low sequencing depth (**1,000-5,000 reads per nucleus**) compared to the gene expression library (
      **20,000-50,000 reads per nucleus**).
    * **Multi-omic Compatibility:** The upstream tagging process makes the method compatible with virtually any
      single-nucleus assay, enabling simultaneous spatial profiling of the transcriptome (snRNA-seq), chromatin
      accessibility (snATAC-seq), and immune receptors from the same tissue section.
