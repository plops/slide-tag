### Section 1: Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS)

* **Core Principle:** Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) is a term for several high-throughput technologies that allow for
  the parallel sequencing of millions to billions of short DNA fragments simultaneously. The dominant method used in
  genomics today, particularly for single-cell applications, is **Illumina's Sequencing by Synthesis (SBS)**.

* **How Sequencing by Synthesis Works:**
    1. **Library Preparation:** The process starts with the collection of DNA to be sequenced (in our case, the barcoded
       cDNA from the single-nucleus workflow). This DNA is fragmented, and special DNA sequences called **adapters** are
       ligated to both ends of each fragment. These adapters are essential, acting as "docking sites" for the sequencing
       process.
    2. **Cluster Generation:** The prepared DNA library is loaded onto a specialized glass slide called a **flow cell**.
       The surface of the flow cell is coated with millions of short DNA strands that are complementary to the adapters.
       Each DNA fragment from the library binds to a complementary strand on the flow cell. A process called **bridge
       amplification** then creates a localized, dense cluster of thousands of identical copies of that single DNA
       fragment. Millions of these clusters are generated simultaneously across the flow cell, each originating from a
       single molecule.
    3. **Sequencing Cycles:** This is the "synthesis" part of SBS. The machine performs a cyclical chemical reaction to
       read the sequence one base at a time.
        * **Step A (Incorporate):** The machine flows a mixture of all four DNA nucleotides (A, C, G, T) across the flow
          cell. Each nucleotide has been modified in two ways: it carries a unique fluorescent color tag, and it has a "
          reversible terminator" that prevents any more bases from being added after it. A single nucleotide binds to
          its complementary base on the template strand in each cluster.
        * **Step B (Image):** The flow cell is washed to remove any unbound nucleotides. A laser then excites the entire
          slide, and a high-resolution camera takes a picture. The color of the fluorescence in each cluster identifies
          which base (A, C, G, or T) was just added.
        * **Step C (Cleave):** A chemical reaction cleaves off both the fluorescent tag and the reversible terminator,
          allowing the next nucleotide to be added in the subsequent cycle.
    4. **Data Readout:** Steps A, B, and C are repeated for hundreds of cycles. In each cycle, the machine records the
       color of every cluster on the flow cell. The final output is a massive text file containing millions of "reads"
       —the sequences of the DNA fragments (e.g., `GATTACA...`), each tied to a specific cluster.

### Section 2: Single-Nucleus RNA Sequencing (snRNA-seq)

* **Primary Goal:** To measure the abundance of messenger RNA (mRNA) in thousands of individual nuclei. This allows for
  the classification of cell types and the study of cellular states based on gene expression profiles. It is especially
  useful for tissues where whole cells are difficult to isolate, such as brain tissue or archived frozen samples.

* **The Role of Commercial Platforms (10x Genomics, BD Rhapsody):**
    * Platforms like the 10x Genomics Chromium or the BD Rhapsody are **not sequencers**. They are sophisticated
      microfluidic "front-end" systems designed to perform the critical upstream steps of single-cell capture and
      barcoding with high efficiency.
    * They automate the process of isolating single nuclei, encapsulating them in droplets with barcoded beads, and
      performing the molecular reactions (lysis, mRNA capture, reverse transcription) inside each droplet.
    * The final output of a 10x Genomics or BD Rhapsody instrument run is a "sequencing-ready library"—the pooled,
      barcoded cDNA that is then loaded onto an NGS sequencer (like an Illumina NovaSeq) for the actual sequencing step
      described in Section 1.

* **The snRNA-seq Mechanism: A Step-by-Step Breakdown**
    1. **Nucleus Isolation:**
        * The process exploits the structural difference between the cell membrane (a single lipid bilayer) and the more
          robust nuclear envelope (a double membrane). A mild detergent selectively dissolves the cell membrane,
          releasing the intact nucleus.
    2. **Droplet-based Capture (The "Front-End"):**
        * A microfluidic controller (e.g., 10x Chromium) partitions a stream of nuclei and a stream of barcoded beads
          into picoliter-sized droplets. The system is calibrated to favor the encapsulation of one nucleus and one bead
          per droplet.
    3. **mRNA Capture and Molecular Barcoding:**
        * Inside each droplet, the nucleus is lysed.
        * The bead is coated with DNA oligonucleotides that act as specific capture molecules.
        * **Capture Target:** Most mRNA molecules in eukaryotes (like humans) have a "poly-A tail" (a string of Adenine
          bases). This distinguishes it from other types of RNA (like ribosomal RNA (rRNA) or transfer RNA (tRNA), which
          are much more abundant in a cell).
        * **Capture Hook:** Each oligo has a "poly(dT) tail" (a string of Thymine bases) that specifically binds to the
          mRNA's poly-A tail.
        * **Barcodes:** Each oligo also contains two crucial identifiers:
            * **Cell Barcode:** Uniquely identifies the nucleus in that droplet.
            * **Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI):** Uniquely identifies each individual mRNA molecule captured.
    4. **Library Preparation and Sequencing:**
        * After the reactions in the droplets [3], the emulsion is broken, and the now-barcoded cDNA is pooled. Adapters are
          added to this cDNA to make it compatible with an NGS machine. This final collection of molecules is the "
          library."
        * This library is loaded onto an NGS sequencer, which reads the sequence of the mRNA fragment as well as the
          attached cell barcode and UMI.

* **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) for Data Quality**
    * **Number of Nuclei Captured:** The total number of cells with sufficient data for analysis.
    * **Median Genes per Nucleus:** The median number of different genes detected per nucleus; a measure of sensitivity.
    * **Median UMIs per Nucleus:** The median count of unique mRNA molecules detected per nucleus; a measure of capture
      efficiency.
    * **Doublet Rate:** The estimated percentage of "barcodes" that actually represent two or more nuclei captured in
      the same droplet.
    * **Mitochondrial RNA Content:** In snRNA-seq, this percentage should be very low. A high value can indicate
      contamination from the cytoplasm due to ruptured nuclei.


| **KPI** | **What it Measures** | **How it's Calculated** | **Typical High-Quality Range** | **Factors Influencing the Metric** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Number of Nuclei Captured** | The total number of individual nuclei for which data is obtained. | The number of unique cell barcodes with a sufficient number of reads. | Thousands to tens of thousands, depending on the platform and experimental goals. | Cell concentration, microfluidic device performance, and downstream filtering criteria. |
| **Median Genes per Nucleus** | The median number of distinct genes detected in a single nucleus. This reflects the sensitivity of the assay. | For each nucleus (cell barcode), count the number of genes with at least one read. Then, find the median of these counts across all nuclei. | 500 - 5,000+ (highly dependent on cell type and sequencing depth). | RNA quality, reverse transcription efficiency, and sequencing depth. |
| **Median UMIs per Nucleus** | The median number of unique mRNA molecules detected per nucleus. This is a measure of the library complexity and capture efficiency. | For each nucleus, count the number of unique UMIs. Then, find the median of these counts across all nuclei. | 1,000 - 20,000+ (highly dependent on cell type and sequencing depth). | RNA content of the nucleus, bead capture efficiency, and PCR amplification cycles. |
| **Fraction of Reads in Nuclei** | The percentage of sequencing reads that are associated with valid cell barcodes. | (Total reads with valid cell barcodes / Total sequencing reads) * 100%. | > 50% | Quality of the single-nucleus suspension, efficiency of droplet encapsulation, and accuracy of barcode identification. |
| **Sequencing Saturation** | The extent to which the sequencing depth has captured the complexity of the library. | 1 - (Number of unique UMIs / Total reads for a given cell barcode). A higher value indicates that further sequencing is unlikely to detect many new molecules. | > 30-50%, depending on the desired level of gene detection. | Total number of sequencing reads relative to the complexity of the cDNA library. |
| **Mitochondrial RNA Content** | The percentage of reads that map to the mitochondrial genome. | (Number of reads mapping to mitochondrial genes / Total reads for a nucleus) * 100%. | Typically < 5% for snRNA-seq. | In snRNA-seq, high mitochondrial RNA is often indicative of cytoplasmic contamination due to incomplete cell lysis or damage to the nuclear membrane. |
| **Doublet Rate** | The percentage of "cells" that are actually two or more nuclei encapsulated in the same droplet. | Estimated computationally based on gene expression profiles or experimentally through sample mixing. | < 1% per 1,000 cells loaded. | The concentration of nuclei loaded into the microfluidic device. |

### Section 3: Slide-tag: Adding Spatial Coordinates to Single-Nucleus Data

* **Primary Goal:** To determine the original (x,y) location within a tissue slice for each nucleus being analyzed. This
  transforms a dissociated list of cells into a spatially resolved map.

* **The Mechanism**
    1. **Spatial Barcoding *in situ*:**
        * A tissue slice is placed on a slide that has a grid of spots, where each spot contains oligonucleotides with a
          unique spatial barcode.
        * The tissue is permeabilized, allowing these spatial barcodes to diffuse in and tag the RNA within the cells
          *while they are still in place*.
    2. **Nucleus Isolation and Workflow Integration:**
        * After this *in situ* tagging, the tissue is dissociated into a single-nucleus suspension.
        * This pool of now spatially-tagged nuclei is then processed using a standard snRNA-seq workflow (e.g., 10x
          Genomics), where a second, single-cell barcode is added.
    3. **Data Integration:**
        * During NGS sequencing, the machine reads three pieces of information for each molecule: the mRNA sequence, the
          spatial barcode, and the single-cell barcode.
        * This dual-barcode system allows researchers to generate a high-quality gene expression profile for each
          nucleus and then use the spatial barcode to map that specific nucleus back to its original location in the
          tissue.

* **Key Advantages and Features**
    * **True Single-Cell Resolution:** Provides gene expression data from individual nuclei, not from groups of cells.
    * **High-Quality Data:** The core gene expression data is of the same high quality as standard snRNA-seq.
    * **Multimodal Compatibility:** The spatially tagged nuclei can be used as input for a variety of other single-cell
      assays that measure different aspects of cell biology.
