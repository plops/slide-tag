create a bullet list summary of the following report. i want to get an understanding of the business units and the projects they are working on. later i will combine this information with their job offers to help gain more insights on the priorities and timelines.

use the financial report to enhance the bullet list more information of the business units and development topics (which parts are just being invested, which make money, which ones are giving the highest profits, which generate the highest costs, ebita)

note that bullet points like this are insufficient: Acquisition of LumiraDx: This acquisition in July 2024 added an innovative point-of-care technology to Roche's portfolio. the summary must clearly state what type of product this company provides. review the other bullet lists if such information is missing. use grounding with google rsearch if necessary.
