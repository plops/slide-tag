*Summarizing Roche's Sequencing by Expansion (SBX) Technology*

Roche has unveiled its breakthrough Sequencing by Expansion (SBX) technology, introducing a new class of next-generation sequencing. This innovative approach combines proprietary SBX chemistry with a high-throughput CMOS-based sensor module to deliver ultra-rapid, scalable, and flexible genomic insights. By encoding target nucleic acid sequences into fifty-times longer "Xpandomers" for highly accurate single-molecule nanopore sequencing with superior signal-to-noise, SBX significantly reduces the time from sample to genome from days to hours. This advancement is poised to revolutionize genomic research and holds substantial promise for future translational and clinical applications in understanding complex diseases like cancer, immune, and neurodegenerative disorders. The technology originated from Stratos Genomics, acquired by Roche in 2020.

*   *New Sequencing Class:* Roche announced its proprietary Sequencing by Expansion (SBX) technology on February 20, 2025, establishing a new category of next-generation sequencing (NGS).
*   *Addressing Complex Diseases:* SBX is designed to provide detailed genetic insights, crucial for decoding complex diseases such as cancer, immune disorders, and neurodegenerative conditions.
*   *Core Innovation:* The technology integrates SBX chemistry with an advanced, high-throughput Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS)-based sensor module.
*   *How it Works (Xpandomers):* SBX encodes the sequence of a target nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) into a measurable "Xpandomer" polymer, which is fifty times longer than the original molecule. These Xpandomers provide high signal-to-noise reporters for accurate single-molecule nanopore sequencing.
*   *Key Benefits:*
    *   *Ultra-rapid:* Reduces the time from sample to genome from days to hours, significantly speeding up genomic research.
    *   *Scalable & Flexible:* Capable of operating across a range of throughput scales, suitable for various project sizes from small studies to large-scale initiatives.
    *   *High Accuracy:* Achieved through clear signals and minimal background noise, a key efficiency driver for the technology.
*   *Broad Applications:* SBX is versatile for whole genome sequencing, whole exome sequencing, and RNA sequencing, with potential for adoption in both research laboratories and future clinical settings.
*   *Leadership Vision:* Matt Sause, CEO of Roche Diagnostics, emphasizes SBX's unparalleled speed, efficiency, and flexibility, foreseeing its potential to revolutionize sequencing in research and healthcare.
*   *Origin of SBX:* The chemistry was invented by Mark Kokoris and Robert McRuer, co-founders of Stratos Genomics, which Roche acquired in 2020.
*   *Complementary Portfolio:* Roche's existing sequencing portfolio includes KAPA sample preparation products and the AVENIO Edge system for automation, along with AVENIO assays for oncology, which play a significant role in the sequencing ecosystem.
